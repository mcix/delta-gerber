### <span id="page-8-1"></span>**1.1 Scope and Target Audience**

This document specifies the Gerber layer format, a UTF-8 format for representing PCB fabrication data. The Gerber format is the de facto standard in the printed circuit board (PCB).

This specification is intended for developers and users of Gerber software. A basic knowledge of PCB design or fabrication is assumed, and knowledge about PCB CAD/CAM is helpful.

### <span id="page-8-2"></span>**1.2 Further Resources**

The Ucamco website contains articles about the use of the Gerber format as well as sample files. For more information about Gerber or Ucamco see [www.ucamco.com,](http://www.ucamco.com/) or mail to [gerber@ucamco.com](mailto:gerber@ucamco.com)

Ucamco strives to make this specification easy to read and unequivocal. If you find a part of this specification unclear, please ask. Your question will be answered, and it will be considered to improve this document. We are grateful for any suggestions for improvement.

### <span id="page-8-3"></span>**1.3 Reference Gerber Viewer**

Ucamco provides a reference Gerber file viewer - free of charge – at gerber-viewer.ucamco.com.

The Reference Gerber Viewer provides an *easy-to-use reference* for both X1 and X2 Gerber files. - the utmost care was taken to display valid Gerber files correctly. It gives a clear warning on risky errors. It is a convenient complement to the written specification. (The specification has precedence if it conflicts with the viewer.)

The Reference Gerber Viewer is an easy tool to *review PCB fabrication data*. For completeness, it also displays drill files in XNC, Excellon and other NC formats as well as netlists in IPC-D-356. If X2 is used the layer structure is displayed, and the function of all objects can be checked – e.g. whether a drill hole is a via or a component hole.

As the Reference Gerber Viewer is a cloud-based online web service there is no software to download, install and maintain –it is always up to date. It is simple and easy to learn. It offers the following benefits:

- *For developers,* it provides an easy way to test their Gerber output and to answer questions about the interpretation of the specification.
- *For users of Gerber files,* it provides an easy way to check the file they have received or are about to send, and to settle discussions about the interpretation of a file.

*You are allowed to integrate a link to the online reference viewer in your website. Email us a [gerber@ucamco.com](mailto:gerber@ucamco.com) for more information.*
