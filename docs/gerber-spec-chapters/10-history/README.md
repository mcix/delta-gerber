The Gerber format derives its name from the former Joseph Gerber, inventor, entrepreneur, and the pioneer of photoplotting. A leading supplier of vector photoplotters from the 1960s onwards, Gerber based its plotter input on a subset of the EIA RS-274-D NC format, and in1980, it published a well-written specification titled "Gerber Format: a subset of EIA RS-274-D; plot data format reference book". The format was well suited for its task and it and became the de-facto standard format for vector plotters, known as *Standard Gerber*.

Vector photoplotters are NC machines, and Standard Gerber, which is dedicated to vector photoplotters, is an NC format. As of the 1980s, raster photoplotters started to replace vector plotters. These newer bitmap devices required more than a simple NC format, so Gerber extended the original NC format with so called "Mass Parameters", converting it to a fullyfledged image format. This resulted in a family of effective image description formats designed specifically to drive Gerber's PCB devices and raster plotters.

In 1998 Gerber Systems Corp. was taken over by Barco and incorporated into its PCB division – Barco ETS, now Ucamco. Barco drew all the variants in Gerber's family of formats into a single standard image format. It was published on September 21, 1998 in the Gerber RS-274X Format User's Guide. The format became known as Extended Gerber or GerberX. Extended Gerber is a full image description format, containing the complete description of a PCB layer. Unlike Standard Gerber, it does not need the support of additional external files, and it specifies planes and pads clearly and simply without the need for painting or vector-fill. The Extended Gerber format quickly superseded Standard Gerber as the de facto standard for PCB image data. It is called "the backbone of the electronics industry". A sequence of revisions clarifying the specification was published over the years, culminating in revision H of January 2012.

During 2012, Ucamco reviewed the entire format in depth. Over 10000 files from all over the world were gathered into a representative library to help establish current practice. Rarely used and historic format elements were deprecated. Format elements with conflicting interpretations in the market were either deprecated or clarified. The specification document itself was reorganized, the quality of the text and the drawings improved and many new drawings added. This resulted in The Gerber Format Specification, revision I1 published in December 2012. Revisions I2, I3 and finally I4 from November 2013 further improved the document. The result was a powerfully clear and simple format, without needless embellishments, focused on the current needs of the PCB industry. This version of the Gerber Format was developed by Karel Tavernier and Rik Breemeersch. They were assisted by an advisory group including Ludek Brukner, Artem Kostyukovich, Jiri Martinek, Adam Newington, Denis Morin, Karel Langhout and Dirk Leroy. Grateful thanks are extended to all those who helped the development of the revision by posting their questions, remarks and suggestions on the Ucamco website. Particular thanks are due to Paul Wells-Edwards whose insightful comments contributed substantially to the revision.

Until this point, Gerber was purely an image description format. Recognizing that a PCB image must be supported with meta-information that describes, say, the function of an image file in the layer structure, Ucamco realized that it could convey that information clearly and unequivocally using attributes. Accordingly, and in June 2013, the company publicly proposed to extend the Gerber format using attributes, and invited feedback on its proposal from the Gerber user community. The outcome of this was revision J1, completed in February 2014, during which Gerber got its attributes. It was a major step forward for the format, at least on a par with the changes made when Standard Gerber became Extended Gerber. Sometimes called the second extension, the latest version of the Gerber format is known as Gerber version 2, or X2 (as opposed to X1, which is Gerber without attributes). Gerber version 2 is fully backward compatible as attributes do not affect the image at all. Subsequent revisions, J2 to J4, clarified the specification and added new standard attributes. Gerber version 2 was developed by Karel

Tavernier, Ludek Brukner and Thomas Weyn. They were assisted by an advisory group including Roland Polliger, Luc Samyn, Wim De Greve, Dirk Leroy and Rik Breemeersch.

In September 2014 Ucamco published an open letter declaring Standard Gerber obsolete and revoking it.

Early in 2015, the entire specification was reviewed once again by Karel Tavernier, Thomas Weyn, and Artem Kostyukovich focused on making the specification easier to read and understand, while taking great care to ensure consistent and precise terminology. Some further elements were identified as superfluous and were deprecated. Not least, special attention was given to the 'Overview' chapter, with the aim of turning it into a tutorial that can be understood by non-experts. The result of this work is revision 2015.06.

In August 2015, Ucamco published a draft specification *adding nested step and repeat* and block apertures to make panel descriptions more efficient, calling for comments from the user community. In November 2016 the review process was closed after substantial input and modifications and the final version included in revision 2016.12. This revision was developed by Karel Tavernier and Rik Breemeersch.

In July 2016 Karel Tavernier from Ucamco published a draft specification to include netlist information in Gerber for public review. Several revisions of the draft were triggered by input from users. The final version was included in revision 2016.11 from November 2, 2016.

In March 2017 Karel Tavernier from Ucamco published a draft specification to include fab documentation in Gerber for public review.

In May 2020 Karel Tavernier from Ucamco published a specification for including component information in Gerber, aka X3.
